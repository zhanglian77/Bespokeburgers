Somewhere on the server side there will be the generation of order numbers.
Order numbers will be based on the most recent order in the database.
If that order was made in the previous day, start order numbers from 0.
Otherwise, it'll be that order number +1

The UI classes will need additional methods to handle UI elements. These were not included in the class diagram.

When calling methods on the UI objects from other objects, you may encounter this exception message:
	java.lang.IllegalStateException: Not on FX application thread;
This happens because we are using multiple threads, and JavaFX is not at all thread safe.
The solution is to wrap the following around the call to those methods: 
Platform.runLater(()->{
	//the method call here
});


We may want to have some way to indicate to the store if there are connection issues to the server
	(i.e. cannot establish connection when first running or connection drops after it was established)
	
	
ServerConnection 57 > Server 88 (null pointer on DRGSTR from web)


Server should calculate final price!
